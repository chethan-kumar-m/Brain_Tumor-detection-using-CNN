**Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN**
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The interface for the project is built using Streamlit.

**Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for building and deploying a brain tumor detection model. The model classifies MRI images into two categories: Tumor and No Tumor.

**Features**
**CNN Model**: Trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
**Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive interface for uploading MRI images and getting predictions.
**Dataset**: Images of brain MRI scans with and without tumors.

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into Tumor and No Tumor categories. The interface is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive way to upload MRI images and get predictions. To use this project, first clone the repository and install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt. Due to the large size, the dataset is not included in this repository; you can download the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle. After downloading the dataset, run the Streamlit interface with streamlit run app.py and upload an MRI image to get the prediction. The project structure includes app.py for the Streamlit interface, model.py for the CNN model architecture and training script, and requirements.txt for the necessary packages.
